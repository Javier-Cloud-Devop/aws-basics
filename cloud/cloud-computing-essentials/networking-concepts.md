# Networking Conceps - VPC, Routing, and Security Groups

## Overview
This lab focused on understanding basic AWS networking components and how they work together to enable secure connectivity between resources inside a VPC. 

All configuration and validation steps were performed using the AWS Management Console (GUI)

The environment consisted of a web server located in apublic subnet and a database server located in a private subnet

## Componentes reviewed
- Virtual Private Xloud (VPC)
- Subnets within a VPC
- Internet Gateway
- Route tables
- Security groups

## Configurations performed
- Explored the networking componenets that make up a VPC
- Configured a route table attached to a subnet within the VPC
- Configured a route table to direct internet-bound traffic to the Internet Gateway
- Configured inbound rules within a security group to control access to resources

## Key concepts learned
- How VPC components are organized and related
- Role of route tables in controlling traffic flow
- PUrpose of an Internet Gatewat for internet connectivity
- How security groups are used to control inbound access
